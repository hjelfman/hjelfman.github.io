I watched castration movie in the way which it was truly meant to be viewed; on a large screen in an university movie theater populated by me, my cinemaphile friend, an older and younger t4t couple, the director of the cinematheque with an unidentifiable accent, my partner's ex, a seventy year old man making soft snoring noises at infrequent intervals (while still awake!), and a guy who happened to know far too much about queer culture. To add to the experience of this menagerie, I was doubled over in pain during the entire five hours of the movie, going through the motions of either food poisoning or a hypertensive crsis brought on by the combinatation of MAOIs and muenster cheese (the low-quality footage of an orchiotomy did not settle the stomach). This is what David Lynch intended when stating that the ideal movie experience was not via phone.

Incel Superman (part one) concerns an emotionally detached man in his first relationship, unable to communicate with his girlfriend of three months as their relationship and his general life circumstances begin to slowly dissolve. He and his girlfriend seem to be dating just to stave off lonlieness; they have nothing in common and negative chemistry, already talking past each other in their introductory diner scene. He displays a remarkable inability to relate to or read others as evidenced by his frequent rants and rambles. When Brooklyn (his girlfriend) finally breaks up with him, he proceeds to get fired from his job and breaks into her apartment, where she is in bed with another woman. After a drawn-out fight, he posts a fundementally flawed description of these events to r9k (a 4chan board for incels? I'm going to be honest and say that I've only ever used lit because I'm very pretentious).

A generous reading of the character attributes his emotional inavailability to some more sympathetic problem -- there are points at which his actions reminded me of my worst behaviors in prior relationships which may have resolved in part due to an acceptance of queerer parts of myself. In particular, while he may accurately be able to recall his own mental state, he is unaware of the state of his relationships and motivations behind them; this ability to read relationships comes with experience that he does not yet have. He knows he is hurting but cannot name the reason why -- he is fundementally alienated in an intrapersonal way. In this, he could be justifiably be compared to James' character in Nevada, who can accurately depict his own mental state, but fails to connect to prior versions of himself to create a coherent life narrative. This is likely far too sympathetic. There exist a great deal of cis-het men unable to relalte to their emotions due to the lack of cultural expectation for them to do so! To attribute this disconnect to a lack of recognized queer identity is a mistake.

Rather, the better reading of his character is that he is truly an incel (who does not help himself in the matter). By placing such a character in a trans* anthology compares the similarityies between many celebate groups and "eggs" (trans people who have not realized they are such yet). There is little daykight between these groups from an exterior view. By doing so, the movie casts a harsher light on the behavior of many in their past lives. This is good. One cannot be truly in the present without accounting for the damage they have done in the past. One is not absolved of all past sin by changing presentation alone -- they must realize and account for it. In this, part one, by displaying the way uin which women are used as a means to prevent lonliness and avoid change among various groups is brought to the surface.

Part two is a series of scenes in the lives of various trans characters in constant danger of crashing out. This is a default mode of operation in many places I've lived; the movie does a wonderful portrayal of this. The characters themselves do not matter; rather, this half of the anthology is best viewed as a skewering of various archetypes which recur again and again.
